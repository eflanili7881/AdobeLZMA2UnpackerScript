# Adobe LZMA2 Unpacker Script
A .bat/.sh script that unpacks LZMA2-compressed Adobe HyperDrive installers to desired location.

# CAUTION!
Please, don't use this script for piracy things. I wrote this script for who wants to store LZMA2-compressed HyperDrive Adobe application installers as unpacked for various reasons. My reason was maximize deduplication ratings on my Windows Server Storage Spaces storage to store more programs. That's why I wrote this script. I will improve this script day by day.
